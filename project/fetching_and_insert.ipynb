It allows data scientists to send training data for bias or data drift monitoring and enables them to create and view bias and data drift metrics for deployed models. Installing an instance of TrustyAI is required for each data science project or namespace that contains models to be monitored. Enabling the TrustyAI component in OpenShift AI is necessary for data scientists to use its model monitoring features. Sending multiple instances of the TrustyAI service in the same project may result in unexpected behavior.\n"
